# Euchre-Simulation

This euchre simulation was used to calculated the probability of winning (or perhaps more specifically the probability of gaining points in) a game of euchre if the dealer picks up. Values were assigned to each card, and the correlation between the net hand value (the sum of the values of the cards in a hand) and winning was found. If the dealer would reach a hand value of 17 or greater by picking up, it is statstically advantageous to pick up.

There are potential flaws with this analysis however. The analysis was based off of only one playing style, so something I hope to do in the future, is modify the program so that multiple playing styles are represented.
